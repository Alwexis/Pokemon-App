# Pokemon-App
A small Pok√©mon App that I'm developing on my free time. The focus of the app is to show the most relevant and complete info about pokemon, and why not, some games to kill free time.

Stack: Ionic & Angular.
I'm using [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co)'s Rest service in order to get the data.

[Here's a video that shows how does the app's current features work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86L_f7WvKEM)

### Still working on it!!!!
